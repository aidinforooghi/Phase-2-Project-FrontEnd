2. Navigate to the backend project directory: `cd phase-2-project-backend`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the backend server: `npm run dev`

### Frontend
1. Clone the frontend repository: `git clone https://github.com/aidinforooghi/phase-2-project-frontend`
2. Navigate to the frontend project directory: `cd phase-2-project-frontend`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the frontend development server: `npm run start`

After following these steps, you will have both the backend and frontend running locally. The backend server should be running on one port, and the frontend development server should be running on another port. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the React Toys App.
